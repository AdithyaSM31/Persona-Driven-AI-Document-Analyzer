# 🚨 VERCEL BUILD FAILED - SOLUTION BELOW 🚨

## ❌ Why Vercel Failed

Your Vercel build failed because:

```
Model Size: ~500MB (sentence-transformers + PyTorch + numpy)
Vercel Limit: 250MB maximum
Result: Build fails - "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'"
```

**Vercel cannot deploy this app.** The ML model is too large.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Use Railway.app

Railway.app is specifically designed for ML/Python apps with **no size limits**.
