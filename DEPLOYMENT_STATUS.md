# 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STATUS & NEXT STEPS

## ✅ What's Been Done

### 1. GitHub Repository - COMPLETE ✓
- **Repository**: https://github.com/AdithyaSM31/Persona-Driven-AI-Document-Analyzer
- **Status**: All code pushed and ready
- **Latest Commit**: Railway deployment support added

### 2. Deployment Files Created
- ✅ `Procfile` - Railway/Heroku deployment
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Python 3.11 specification
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Updated with gunicorn
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel config (for reference)

### 3. Documentation Created
- ✅ `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` - Railway deployment guide (RECOMMENDED)

## ⚠️ Important: Vercel Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Vercel build failed because:
- ML model (sentence-transformers + PyTorch) = ~500MB
- Vercel limit = 250MB
- ❌ Model too large for Vercel

**Solution**: Deploy to **Railway.app** or **Render.com** instead
- ✅ No size limits
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ Built for ML/Python apps
- ✅ Better performance (no cold starts)
