## ✅ What's Been Done

1. ✅ Created `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
2. ✅ Created `api/index.py` - Serverless function
3. ✅ Created `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
4. ✅ Created `.vercelignore` - Vercel ignore rules
5. ✅ Updated `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
6. ✅ Initialized Git repository
7. ✅ Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/AdithyaSM31/Persona-Driven-AI-Document-Analyzer

## 🚀 Deploy Now (3 Steps)

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com
2. **Click**: "Add New" → "Project"

## 📊 Key Files for Vercel

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `vercel.json` | Routes and Python runtime config |
| `api/index.py` | Serverless Flask function |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `.vercelignore` | Exclude model/uploads from deployment |

## ⚡ What Happens on Vercel?

1. Vercel reads `vercel.json`
2. Installs Python packages from `requirements.txt`
3. Deploys `api/index.py` as serverless function
4. Serves static files from `static/` and `templates/`
5. Downloads ML model on first request (~30 seconds)
6. Caches model for fast subsequent requests
